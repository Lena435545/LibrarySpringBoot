# Library Management System

A learning-focused web application.  
Created to explore CRUD development with multiple related entities using Java and Spring MVC.  
Includes form handling with Thymeleaf, database integration with PostgreSQL, basic unit testing using JUnit, and
frontend development with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS.

The application allows users to:

- manage books, movies, and journals (create, edit, delete),
- upload and display cover images,
- register library members,
- assign and release items (check-out and return),
- toggle between light and dark themes (stored in localStorage).

---

## Features

### Library Items Management

- Manage **Books**, **Movies**, and **Journals**
- Create, edit, delete, view details
- Upload images (covers/posters)
- Default placeholder image if no image is uploaded

### Member Management

- Register new members
- Assign items to members (Check-out)
- Release items back to the library (Check-in)

### Dynamic Theme Switching

- Toggle between light and dark mode
- Preference stored in browser `localStorage`

### Server-Side Rendering

- Thymeleaf for dynamic views, form handling, and error display

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Java 17+
- Maven
- PostgreSQL

### Database Setup

Manually create a PostgreSQL database and user:

```sql
CREATE
DATABASE library_db;
CREATE
USER your_username WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE
library_db TO your_username;
```

Add/update the following properties in your `application.properties`:

```properties
db.driver=org.postgresql.Driver
db.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/library_db
db.username=your_username
db.password=your_password
upload.dir=your/absolute/path/to/images
```

### Running the Application

#### Step 1: Build the project

```bash
mvn clean package
```

This will generate a WAR file under the `target/` directory, for example:

```bash
target/my-app.war
```

#### Step 2: Deploy the WAR file to Tomcat

- Copy the generated WAR file into the `webapps/` directory of your local Tomcat installation.
- Start Tomcat (`catalina.sh run` or via IDE).
- Tomcat will automatically deploy and unpack the WAR.

#### Step 3: Access the application

```bash
http://localhost:8080/my-app/
```

Replace `my-app` with the actual name of your WAR file (without the `.war` extension).

## Testing

### Test Coverage

- Unit tests written for service layer (e.g. `BookServiceTest`)
- Currently covers CRUD operations
- Further validation and error handling tests planned

### Running Tests

```bash
mvn test
```
